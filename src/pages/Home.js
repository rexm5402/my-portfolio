      <h1>Hi, I’m Aryan Murugesh — a builder at heart, a problem-solver by mindset.</h1>
      
      <p>
        I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, with a specialization in Software Systems.
        From designing robust web apps to exploring the frontier of machine unlearning, I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex
        problems into scalable, secure, and real-world-ready solutions. With hands-on experience as a front-end developer and published
        research paper in cybersecurity, I bring both technical depth and practical execution to the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio is more than a showcase — it’s a window into how I think and build.
        Whether it’s a sleek front-end interface, a blockchain-powered dApp, or a privacy-focused Chrome extension, each project reflects
        my obsession with clean architecture, user-centric design, and impactful functionality. If you're looking for someone who codes
        with purpose, iterates with curiosity, and never stops learning — you're in the right place.
